# IMU_collaborativerobotics-
The provided code establishes a communication link between an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and a collaborative robot. The primary purpose is to read sensor data from the IMU and use it to control the robot's movements and operations. This ensures precise motion control and responsiveness to environmental changes, enhancing the robot control

# function_pool 
This script contains a collection of functions to interact with an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and a servo motor controlled via an Arduino. The functions include conversion of rotation matrices to Euler angles, acquiring Euler angles from the IMU, and calibrating and converting encoder data for servo motors.

# osc_encoder 
This Python script provides functionality to decode Open Sound Control (OSC) messages and bundles

# mirrorng 
This script involves recording trajectory data using an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) with both a single thread and a multi threading approach. 

# control_real_time
This script implements a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller to control a servo motor based on the angle readings from an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and an encoder. The script runs in a Python environment and communicates with an Arduino board to read encoder values and control the servo motor.
